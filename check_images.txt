Answer:I would choose resnet or alexnet. Although all three models were successful in differentiating between dogs and non-dogs, vgg was not successful in classifying all the non-dog images correctly. Vgg classified my picture of the cat as angora rabbit, but the other two models were successful in classifying it as a cat. Hence, based on image classification accuracy, I would choose resnet or alexnet. There really is no point in choosing between these two models because they produce the same results as seen.
